# MindXLib

MindXLib is an open toolkit ensemble of algorithmic achievements in XAI (Explainable AI) from the Data Decision Team at Alibaba DAMO Academy's Decision Intelligence Lab.

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

## Installation

You can install MindXLib using pip:

```bash
pip install mindxlib
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone http://gitlab.alibaba-inc.com/MindXAI/MindXLib.git
cd mindxlib
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Feature Attribution with SHAP

```python
import xgboost
import shap # just for retrival of adult dataset
from mindxlib import ShapExplainer

# Load adult dataset
X, y = shap.datasets.adult()

# Train XGBoost classifier
model = xgboost.XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Initialize Tree SHAP explainer
explainer = ShapExplainer(model, method="tree")

# Generate explanations
explanation = explainer.explain(X[:1000], baseline=X, mode="origin")

# Show scatter plot for Age feature
explanation.show('scatter', feature='Age')
```

### Rule Learning with SSRL

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from mindxlib import SSRL
from mindxlib.data import tic_tac_toe

# Load tic-tac-toe dataset
X, y = tic_tac_toe()

# Initialize and fit SSRL
explainer = SSRL(cc=10, lambda_1=1, distorted_step=10, 
                categorical_features=X.columns.tolist())
explainer.fit(X, y)

# Show learned rules
explainer.show()

# Make predictions
predictions = explainer.predict(X)
acc = np.sum(predictions.values == y.values) / y.shape[0]
print(f'Training accuracy: {acc:.2f}')

# Example output:
'''
IF 1==o AND 4==o AND 7==o, THEN negative
ELIF 3==o AND 4==o AND 5==o, THEN negative
ELIF 0==o AND 1==o AND 2==o, THEN negative
ELIF 6==o AND 7==o AND 8==o, THEN negative
ELIF 0==o AND 3==o AND 6==o, THEN negative
ELIF 2==o AND 5==o AND 8==o, THEN negative
ELIF 0!=x AND 4!=x AND 8!=x, THEN negative
ELIF 2!=x AND 4!=x AND 6!=x, THEN negative
ELSE positive
Training accuracy: 0.98
'''
```
